# Setting Up a React + Vite Project

This guide provides the necessary steps to set up and run a React project using Vite.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js and npm**
Ensure **Node.js** is installed, as it includes `npm` (Node Package Manager).

### **üîπ Windows/macOS/Linux:**
- Download **Node.js LTS** from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Verify installation by running:  
  ```sh
  node -v   # Check Node.js version
  npm -v    # Check npm version
  ```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to get the project files locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with the actual values.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
If the React frontend is in a subfolder (`frontend`), move into it:

```sh
cd client
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all packages listed in `package.json`.

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server**
To start the project in development mode with **Vite**, use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch the project on a local server. The terminal will display a local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`).

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Stopping the Development Server**
To stop the server, press:

```
CTRL + C
```

---

Now the project is ready for development! üöÄ
